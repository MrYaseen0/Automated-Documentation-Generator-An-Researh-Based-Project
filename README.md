# Automated-Documentation-Generator-An-Researh-Based-Project
🚀 Generative AI-Driven Documentation Engine | Bridging the gap between raw code and human-readable prose. Built for the Software Architecture &amp; Design project at CECOS University, this system uses Transformer-based LLMs to automate docstring and comment generation with 96% parsing accuracy.

💡 The Vision
In modern software engineering, documentation is often the first thing sacrificed for speed. My project, the Automated Documentation Generator, reclaims that lost time. By transforming documentation from a "static snapshot" into a "living entity" integrated into the development workflow, we reduce developer prose-writing overhead by an estimated 70%.

🛠️ How It Works: The "Magic" Pipeline
Unlike simple text-completion tools, this system performs deep structural analysis:


Lexical Scanning: Verified support for Python, Java, JavaScript, C++, and Go.


Contextual Extraction: The engine identifies function signatures, parameter types, and internal logic flow.


Transformer Inference: Uses top-tier models like GPT-4o and LLaMA 3 to synthesize high-fidelity docstrings.


AST Validation: Every output is cross-referenced against the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to ensure no parameter or return value is left undocumented.

📈 Performance Benchmarks

Speed: Generates a full function description in just 3.2 seconds.


Accuracy: Achieved a 96% parsing accuracy on standard libraries.


Architecture: Follows a Decoupled Client-Server Model for maximum scalability.
